Proposed Project: Smoking Cessation Mobile Application (tentative name)

I. Overview of the Social Issue
       The leading cause of preventable cancer is tobacco. Preventable cancers are
   type of cancers that are a result of a person's lifestyle, such as food intake
   and activity levels. Worldwide, 5.4 million deaths yearly is caused by the
   consumption of tobacco, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). They
   have also surmised that a billion may die in this century if the current number
   of people who smoke do not decrease.
       Smoking brings absolutely no benefits, at least none that had been verified
   by doctors. In fact, it only brings harm to the smoker and to the people surrounding
   them as well. Health risks to the smoker include various types of cancer, lung and
   heart diseases, negative effects in the reproductive health in both men and women,
   which in turn would result to premature babies who are born with health
   complications, and eye defects which eventually lead to blindness. Effects caused
   by secondhand smoke are equally devastating. Secondhand smoke causes 600,000 deaths
   yearly according to the World Health Organization.
       Despite the government's fervent efforts to curb the unhealthy habit of smoking
       cigarettes among Filipinos, many still continue this practice. According to the
       Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), 28% of thr Filipino adults aged 15 years
       and older are tobacco smokers.
